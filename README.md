Projects utilizing the Aforge.NET framework

This repository includes some pretty old projects that I had made about ~2009 using the excellent AForge.NET framework. It seems that the framework is not actively being maintained any longer but its details are available at http://www.aforgenet.com/.

The projects should run on any Windows 7+ system with the latest .NET framework. As against normal practive, I've retained the built binaries (both debug + release) for all these projects in their /bin folder. This is to allow folks to run those programs without having to first build them. Another warning: the projects require Visual Studo 2010+ to explore and build. Express versions should work. I have not tried on IDE's later than VS 2010 - the last I built these was years back!

I have put these up here only for interested people who would like to learn about computer vision in an approachable manner, especially those that are comfortable with Windows programming and C# on .NET. Note that there are equally good (or better) framework's available now (as of writing this in 2018).
